mist - mobility and infrastructure simulation tool
==================================================

**mist** is a Python application for simulating the effects of hypothetical 
electrified mobility as a service (MaaS) applications on electric
infrastructure, levels of service, and additional energy outcomes. Developed in
2019 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), mist is an
agent-based model that simulates MaaS operations over real world trip data.
