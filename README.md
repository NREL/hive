HIVE is a mobility services research platform developed by the Mobility and Advanced Powertrains (MBAP) group at
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, USA.

## What is HIVE

HIVE is an agent-based model (ABM) for modeling the performance of ride hail fleets over
arbitrary supply/demand scenarios. Models for mobility services often have a large barrier-
to-entry due to the complex interactions of mode choice, economics, and model tuning required
to use the leading mesoscopic transportation models (BEAM, POLARIS, MATSim, etc.). HIVE attempts
to fill a gap for researchers seeking to study the economic and energy impacts of autonomous
ride hail fleets by providing the following features:

- dynamic dispatch, trip energy, routing, and economics
    - price signals limited to fleet and energy grid with exogenous request data
- simple to define/share scenarios
- easy integration/co-simulation (can be called alongside other software tools)
- 100% Python code

The project is currently closed-source and in alpha development, with plans to open-source in summer of 2020.
The developer API can be found at [docs/index.html](/docs/index.html).

## Dependencies

HIVE has only two major dependencies. Uber H3 is a geospatial index which HIVE uses for
positioning and search. PyYAML is used to load YAML-based configuration and scenario files.

- [H3](https://github.com/uber/h3)
- [PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)

While HIVE is also dependent on the following libraries, there are plans to remove them.
Pint is a units library, Haversine provides the Haversine distance function. Numpy is being
used to interpolate tabular data.  

- [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.10/)
- [haversine](https://github.com/mapado/haversine)
- [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)

## Setup

Setting up hive can be accomplished in a couple steps. First you need to 
make sure you have the right packages installed. An easy way to do this 
is to use conda which can be obtained here:

- [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (anaconda)
- [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (miniconda)

To build the environment simply run:

    > conda env create -f environment.yml
    
Then, activate the environment with:

    > conda activate hive

## Running a Scenario

Hive v0.3.0 comes packaged with a demo scenario for Downtown Denver. In order
to run our demo scenario we just need to navigate to the app/ sub directory
and run:

    > python run.py scenarios/denver_demo.yaml

This runs the demo scenario and writes outputs to `app/denver_demo_outputs`
