HIVE is a mobility services research platform developed by the Mobility and Advanced Powertrains (MBAP) group at
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, USA.

## What is HIVE

HIVE is model for evaluating the performance of ride hail fleets over
arbitrary supply/demand scenarios. Models for mobility services often have a large barrier-
to-entry due to the complex interactions of mode choice, economics, and model tuning required
to use the leading mesoscopic transportation models (BEAM, POLARIS, MATSim, etc.). HIVE attempts
to fill a gap for researchers seeking to study the economic and energy impacts of autonomous
ride hail fleets by providing the following features:

- agent-based model (ABM)
- data-driven control interfaces for Model-Predicted Control and Reinforcement Learning research
- easy integration/co-simulation (can be called alongside other software tools)
- dynamic dispatch, trip energy, routing, and economics
    - price signals limited to fleet and energy grid with exogenous request data
- simple to define/share scenarios via configuration files and simulation snapshots
- 100% Python (v 3.8) code with a small number of dependencies

The project is currently closed-source and in alpha development, with plans to open-source in summer of 2020.

## Dependencies

At this point, HIVE 

HIVE has only two major dependencies. Uber H3 is a geospatial index which HIVE uses for
positioning and search. PyYAML is used to load YAML-based configuration and scenario files.

- [H3](https://github.com/uber/h3)
- [PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)

While HIVE is also dependent on the following libraries, there are plans to remove them.
Pint is a units library, Haversine provides the Haversine distance function. Numpy is being
used to interpolate tabular data.  

- [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.10/)
- [haversine](https://github.com/mapado/haversine)
- [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)

## Setup

Setting up hive can be accomplished in a couple steps. First you need to 
make sure you have the right packages installed. An easy way to do this 
is to use conda which can be obtained here:

- [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (anaconda)
- [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (miniconda)

To build the environment simply run:

    > conda env create -f environment.yml
    
Then, activate the environment with:

    > conda activate hive
    
The developer API is a [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) project which can be built by installing 
Sphinx with type hints via `pip install sphinx-autodoc-typehints` and following the build instructions.

## Running a Scenario

![Map of Denver Downtown](app/scenarios/denver_demo.jpg?raw=true)

Running HIVE takes one argument, which is a configuration file. Hive v0.3.0 comes packaged with a demo scenario 
for Downtown Denver, located at `app/scenarios/denver_demo.yaml`. This file names the inputs and the configuration
Parameters for running HIVE. Additional parameters exist with default values assigned, which will be documented in 
a future version of HIVE.

In order to run our demo scenario we just need to navigate to the `app/` sub directory and run HIVE:

    > cd app
    > python run.py scenarios/denver_demo.yaml

This runs the demo scenario and writes outputs to `app/denver_demo_outputs`. These output files can be parsed 
by Pandas using `pd.read_json(output_file.json, lines=True)` (for Pandas > 0.19.0).

## Roadmap

HIVE intends to implement the following features:

- Routing from OSM networks with time-varying speeds
- Revised trip energy & recharging
- Economics
- Fleet control algorithms from literature for more optimal control
- Gasoline vehicles
- Integration into vehicle and grid energy models
- Dynamic energy pricing
- Distributed HPC cluster implementation for large problem inputs
