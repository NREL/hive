HIVE is a mobility services research platform developed by the Mobility and Advanced Powertrains (MBAP) group at
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, USA.

## What is HIVE

HIVE is model for evaluating the performance of ride hail fleets over
arbitrary supply/demand scenarios. Models for mobility services often have a large barrier-
to-entry due to the complex interactions of mode choice, economics, and model tuning required
to use the leading mesoscopic transportation models (BEAM, POLARIS, MATSim, etc.). HIVE attempts
to fill a gap for researchers seeking to study the economic and energy impacts of autonomous
ride hail fleets by providing the following features:

- agent-based model (ABM)
- data-driven control interfaces for Model-Predicted Control and Reinforcement Learning research
- easy integration/co-simulation (can be called alongside other software tools)
- dynamic dispatch, trip energy, routing, and economics
    - price signals limited to fleet and energy grid with exogenous request data
- simple to define/share scenarios via configuration files and simulation snapshots
- 100% Python (v 3.8) code with a small number of dependencies

The project is currently closed-source and in alpha development, with plans to open-source in summer of 2020.

## Dependencies

HIVE has only three major dependencies. Uber H3 is a geospatial index which HIVE uses for
positioning and search. PyYAML is used to load YAML-based configuration and scenario files.
Immutables provides the implementation of an immutable map to replace the standard Python 
Dictionary, which will be available in Python 3.9.

- [H3](https://github.com/uber/h3)
- [PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)
- [immutables](https://github.com/MagicStack/immutables)

While HIVE is also dependent on the following libraries, there are plans to remove them.
Pint is a units library, Haversine provides the Haversine distance function. Numpy is being
used to interpolate tabular data.

- [haversine](https://github.com/mapado/haversine)
- [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)

## Setup

HIVE is currently available on [github.nrel.gov](github.nrel.gov). You must be connected
(via LAN/VPN) to NREL and have an account with the correct access privileges to access it.

    > git clone https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/hive

#### install and run via pip

to load hive as a command line application via pip, tell pip to install hive by pointing to the directory
that git downloaded:

    > python -m pip install -e <path/to/hive>
   
Then you can run hive as a command line application:

    > hive hive/resources/scenarios/denver_demo.yaml

#### run as a vanilla python module

To run from the console, run the module (along with a scenario file, such as `denver_demo.yaml`):
       
    > cd hive
    > python -m hive hive/resources/scenarios/denver_demo.yaml 

#### build api documentation (optional)

The developer API is a [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) project which can be built by installing 
Sphinx with type hints via `pip install sphinx-autodoc-typehints` and following the build instructions.

## Looking at a default scenario

![Map of Denver Downtown](docs/images/denver_demo.jpg?raw=true)

Running HIVE takes one argument, which is a configuration file. Hive comes packaged with a demo scenario 
for Downtown Denver, located at `hive/resources/scenarios/denver_demo.yaml`. This file names the inputs and the configuration
Parameters for running HIVE.

the Denver demo scenario is configured to log output to a folder named `denver_demo_outputs` which is also tagged
with a timestamp. These output files can be parsed by Pandas using `pd.read_json(output_file.json, lines=True)` (for Pandas > 0.19.0). 
Additionally, some high-level stats are shown at the console.

Running this scenario should produce an output similar to the following:

```
##     ##  ####  ##     ##  #######
##     ##   ##   ##     ##  ##
#########   ##   ##     ##  ######
##     ##   ##    ##   ##   ##
##     ##  ####     ###     #######

- Routing from OSM networks with time-varying speeds
- Revised trip energy & recharging
- Fleet control algorithms from literature for more optimal control
- Gasoline vehicles
- Integration into vehicle and grid energy models
- Distributed HPC cluster implementation for large problem inputs
