HIVE™ is an open-source mobility services research platform developed by the Mobility, Behavior, and Advanced Powertrains (MBAP) group at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, USA.

HIVE supports researchers who explore **Electric Vehicle (EV) fleet control**, **Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) siting**, and **fleet composition** problems, and is designed for _ease-of-use_, _scalability_, and _co-simulation_.
Out-of-the-box, it provides a baseline set of algorithms for fleet dispatch, but provides a testbed for exploring alternatives from leading research in model-predictive control (MPC) and deep reinforcement learning.
HIVE is designed to integrate with vehicle power and energy grid power models in real-time for accurate, high-fidelity energy estimation over arbitrary road networks and demand scenarios.

## Installation

HIVE depends on a Python installation [3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10] and the pip package manager ( [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
In our installation example we use [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) | [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for managing a HIVE Python environment.

### via pip

    > pip install nrel.hive

### build from source

Via conda, create a dedicated 'hive' Python environment:

    > conda create -n hive python=3.8 
    > conda activate hive

to run tests, also install `pytest`:

    > pip install pytest

to load hive as a command line application along with all dependencies into your conda environment:

    > git clone https://github.com/NREL/hive.git
    > cd hive
    > pip install -e .

## Run HIVE

run a test of hive using a [built-in scenario](#built-in-scenarios):

    > hive denver_demo.yaml

if you want the program to use a file outside of this location, provide a valid path:

    > hive some_other_directory/my_scenario.yaml

## Built-In Scenarios

The following built-in scenario files come out-of-the-box, and available directly by name:

scenario | description
---------|------------
denver_demo.yaml | default demo scenario with 20 vehicles and 2.5k requests synthesized with uniform time/location sampling
denver_rl_toy.yaml | extremely simple scenario for testing RL
denver_demo_constrained_charging.yaml | default scenario with limited charging supply
denver_demo_fleets.yaml | default scenario with two competing TNC fleets
manhattan.yaml | larger test scenario with 200 vehicles and 20k requests sampled from the NY Taxi Dataset

## Scenario configuration

Scenarios are run by reading a YAML file describing the parameters of the simulation. The files list all scenario-specific parameters but can fall back to defaults set [here](https://github.com/NREL/hive/blob/main/nrel/hive/resources/defaults/hive_config.yaml).

Scenario YAML files organize a list of resource files to use as input. If a file resource is listed which doesn't resolve to a local file path, HIVE will search for a default resource [here](nrel/hive/resources). By default, HIVE expects file resources stored in a directory matching their resource type. For example, using the [default Denver scenario](nrel/hive/resources/scenarios/denver_downtown/denver_demo.yaml):

```yaml
...
input:
  vehicles_file: denver_demo_vehicles.csv  # vehicles/denver_demo_vehicles.csv
  requests_file: denver_demo_requests.csv  # requests/denver_demo_requests.csv
  bases_file: denver_demo_bases.csv        # bases/denver_demo_bases.csv
...
```

For a description of file contents and schemas, please read our [technical report](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/80682.pdf). Example scenario and resource data can be found [here](nrel/hive/resources).  

## Global configuration

Some values are set by a global configuration file with filename `.hive.yaml`.
The defaults are set in the repo [here](nrel/hive/resources/defaults/.hive.yaml).
If you want to override any entries in this file, you can create a new one by the same name `.hive.yaml` and place it in your working directory or a parent directory.
Hive will also check your base user directory for this file (aka `~/.hive.yaml`).
This can be useful if you would like to reduce the output files or change the default output base directory (for example, to something like `~/hive/output`).

## Dependencies

HIVE attempts to rely on as few dependencies as possible. For the most part, these dependencies are obvious choices from the open-source Python analysis ecosystem:

- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) (bipartite matching optimization)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org) (linear interpolation of energy lookup tables)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) (file IO)
- [networkx](https://networkx.org) (underlying network model)
- [pyyaml](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) (command line progress bars)

Beyond these, HIVE uses Uber H3, a geospatial index which HIVE uses for positioning and search, and MagicStack Immutables, which provides the implementation of an immutable Map to replace the standard Python `Dict` type. The Returns library provides Python-approximations for functional containers. Links provided here:

- [h3](https://github.com/uber/h3) (spatial index)
- [immutables](https://github.com/MagicStack/immutables) ([HAMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie) implementation for "immutable dict")
- [returns](https://github.com/dry-python/returns) (functional containers)

## Developer documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://readthedocs.org/nrel-hive).

## Why HIVE?

When the Mobility, Behavior, and Advanced Powertrains group began looking to answer questions related to fleet sizing, charging infrastructure, and dynamic energy pricing, we could not find a simulator which was right-sized for our research questions. Most modern models for mobility services have a large barrier-to-entry due to the complex interactions of mode choice, economics, and model tuning required to use the leading micro and mesoscopic transportation models (BEAM, POLARIS, MATSim, SUMO, AMoDeus, etc.). Additionally, they have heavyweight technical infrastructure demands where deployment of these models requires a specialized team. HIVE attempts to fill a gap for researchers seeking to study the economic and energy impacts of autonomous ride hail fleets by providing the following feature set:

- agent-based model (ABM)
- data-driven control interfaces for Model-Predicted Control and Reinforcement Learning research
- easy integration/co-simulation (can be called alongside other software tools)
- dynamic dispatch, trip energy, routing, and economics
- simple to define/share scenarios via configuration files and simulation snapshots
- 100% Python (v 3.7) code with a small(ish) set of dependencies and well-documented code

HIVE is _not_ a fully-featured [Activity-Based Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_forecasting#Activity-based_models), does _not_ simulate all vehicles on the network, and does not simulate congestion. It also assumes demand is fixed. If these assumptions are too strong for your research question, then one of the other mesoscopic models capable of ridehail simulation may be a more appropriate fit. The following (opinionated) chart attempts to compare features of HIVE against LBNL's BEAM and ANL's POLARIS models.

## Looking at a default scenario

![Map of Denver Downtown](docs/source/_static/denver_demo.jpg?raw=true)

Running HIVE takes one argument, which is a configuration file. Hive comes packaged with a demo scenario for Downtown Denver, located at `hive/resources/scenarios/denver_demo.yaml`. This file names the inputs and the configuration Parameters for running HIVE.

the Denver demo scenario is configured to log output to a folder named `denver_demo_outputs` which is also tagged with a timestamp. These output files can be parsed by Pandas (for Pandas > 0.19.0):

```python
import pandas as pd
# log files store JSON rows, like a document store
output_file = "~/hive/output/denver_demo_2021-02-08_11-00-07/state.log"
pd.read_json(output_file, lines=True)
```

By default, these outputs are generated:

file name                        | file type | description
-------------------------------- | --------- | -----------
\<config\>.yaml                  | YAML      | the input configuration serialized (can be read back by HIVE)
run.log                          | text      | console log output
event.log                        | JSON rows | events that occur, such as vehicle movement, pickup + dropoff events, etc
instruction.log                  | JSON rows | instructions sent from dispatcher to drivers
state.log                        | JSON rows | entity states at every time step
station_capacities.csv           | CSV       | energy load capacity for each station
summary_stats.json               | JSON      | summary stats as displayed in run.log but in JSON format
time_step_stats_{$FLEET|all}.csv | CSV       | aggregated data across a fleet (or all fleets) by time step

Running this scenario should also feed some logging into the console.
First, HIVE announces where it is loading configuration from (1).
It then dumps the global and scenario configuration to the console (2).
Finally, after around 65 lines, it begins running the simulation with a progress bar (3).
After, it prints the summary stats to the console and exits (4).
