Welcome to hive's documentation!
================================

HIVEâ„¢ is an open-source mobility services research platform developed by the Mobility and Advanced Powertrains (MBAP) group at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, USA.

HIVE supports researchers who explore Electric Vehicle (EV) fleet control, Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) siting, and fleet composition problems, and is designed for ease-of-use, scalability, and co-simulation. 
Out-of-the-box, it provides a baseline set of algorithms for fleet dispatch, but provides a testbed for exploring alternatives from leading research in model-predictive control (MPC) and deep reinforcement learning. 
HIVE is designed to integrate with vehicle power and energy grid power models in real-time for accurate, high-fidelity energy estimation over arbitrary road networks and demand scenarios.
