Unit tests for MIST development.  
___
  
Unit tests should meet the following criteria (from [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/)):  
* A testing unit should focus on one small piece of functionality & prove it correct  
* Each test unit should be fully independent (i.e. standalone).  
* Tests should be as fast as possible.  
* Tests should be run before pushing to remote (this can be an automated hook).  
* When identifying a bug in the code, a test should be written to ensure that the bug is never re-encountered.  
* Use long, descriptive names for testing functions. That way, if a test fails, the traceback is as descriptive as possible.
